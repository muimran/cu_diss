        <section class="para-1">
          <p>This summer, Bangladesh has once again found itself in the global spotlight. 
            Student-led protests began in early July 2024 with demands to reform how government jobs are allocated, 
            and culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. She fled the country, but not 
            before her security forces had allegedly killed hundreds of student protesters across Bangladesh. Western media 
            outlets scrambled to cover the dramatic turn of events, with striking photos of protesters storming the Prime Minister's 
            residence dominating the homepages of major news outlets. While these moments of intense coverage are often crisis-driven, 
            they also raise a broader question: What do Western media outlets talk about when they talk about Bangladesh?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="para-1">
          <p>Outlets like BBC, CNN, Fox, The Telegraph, The Guardian, and The New York Times follow a pretty familiar pattern when 
            it comes to Bangladesh. Coverage tends to spike during big disasters—think the Rana Plaza collapse or the Rohingya crisis. 
            But what about when there's no major crisis? To dig deeper, I analysed nearly 2,000 articles from 2012 to 2024 to spot the 
            recurring themes that show how the world sees this country.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="para-1">
          <p>I focused on six major news outlets from the US and UK, selected for being the most-visited, according 
            to <a href="https://www.similarweb.com">SimilarWeb</a>, which ranks sites by how much traffic they get. 
            They reach millions of readers and by looking at how they cover Bangladesh, we get a glimpse of how the country 
            is framed for audiences in two of the world’s biggest media markets. Using "Bangladesh" as my keyword, I pulled articles 
            from 2012 to June 2024 to see how these media giants are shaping the conversation.</p>

          <h2>Negative Narratives </h2>
        </section>
        <br></br>

        <section class="para-1">
          <p>I analysed all the collected articles and categorised them into themes such as politics, natural disasters, 
            refugee crises, and labor issues. These categories reveal not just what makes the news, but also how the narratives 
            are shaped. Moments of heightened media attention—such as the Rohingya refugee crisis or the Rana Plaza collapse—tend 
            to drive coverage, while stories outside of these crises often reflect broader, ongoing issues that define how Bangladesh 
            is portrayed globally. </p>

                around 1% of all the articles. It’s clear the focus leans toward crises rather than the everyday life or growth of the nation.</div>

                striking contrast to the crime-heavy coverage elsewhere.</div>

        <br></br>

        <section class="para-1">
          <p>Each country has a few places that are better known, and media coverage tends to concentrate on those hotspots—often because
             major events happen there, or they are the big cities or key economic centers. Bangladesh is no different. To explore this pattern, 
             I extracted every place name mentioned in the 2,000 articles and mapped them to the country’s 64 districts. My goal was to see if the 
             media’s focus is spread across the entire country or concentrated in just a few familiar regions. This analysis helps reveal whether 
             the coverage offers a full picture of Bangladesh or repeatedly focuses on the same areas.</p>

                13%, and Sylhet in the north-east corner comes in at 5%. The rest of the country is almost entirely overlooked.</p>

              <p><strong>Fox News</strong> gives the most coverage to Dhaka, with 83% of their mentions focused on places within the district. 
                The only other place that even registers is Chittagong, with just 4%. The rest of the country? Almost completely off the radar.</p>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
              <p>When looking at the combined map for <strong>all publications</strong>, the pattern is clear: Dhaka dominates. Three-quarters of all places mentioned 
                are in or around the capital, with the second city Chittagong coming in at just 8%. In fact, the international media’s coverage of 
                Bangladesh is really just coverage of Dhaka. The rest of the country barely gets a mention.

            to trade deals with the US or diplomatic tensions with India, Bangladesh is rarely reported on its own. By mapping 
            every country mentioned alongside Bangladesh in 2,000 articles, I found that its story is frequently told through its 
            connections with the wider world. Be it in times of conflict or cooperation, these links offer a glimpse into Bangladesh’s

              <p>The Guardian ties Bangladesh to 80 different countries in its coverage, more than any other outlet. 
                A big part of this likely comes from their focus on sports coverage, especially cricket. As one of the top 
                cricket-playing nations in the world, Bangladesh's international connections often play out through the sport. </p>

            <div class="step2" data-step="2">
              <p>One surprising thing about The Guardian’s coverage is how often Africa comes up.

            <div class="step2" data-step="3">
              <p>CNN’s coverage of Bangladesh is narrower and mentions only about 50 other countries. Half of those are in Asia, 
                with Myanmar standing out the most because of how much attention the Rohingya crisis has received in their reporting.</p>

            <div class="step2" data-step="4">
              <p>Overall, Bangladesh's neighbours account for nearly 40% of the mentions, with India being the most prominent at 16%. 
                The majority of the remaining mentions go to the UK, USA, and European countries. A significant portion of the UK's mentions

    or "Bangladeshi" in the headlines. For outlets like <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Guardian</em>, I used their APIs to 
    easily pull the links. For those without APIs, I wrote custom Python scripts and used Octoparse to speed up the scraping process. 
    For BBC, where scraping was trickier, I used Google’s site search to find the relevant articles. All URLs were stored in a CSV file for easy access later.

    Extracting the article content wasn’t always easy. Some sites loaded content dynamically, meaning the full text would only 
    appear after scrolling or interacting with the page. To handle this, I automated those actions using <strong>Selenium</strong>. 
    Once I had the content, I saved it along with metadata like publication dates and author names in <strong>JSON</strong> format.

  <strong>Category:</strong> When I collected the articles, very few of them had 
  pre-assigned categories from the publications. Even when they did, 
  the categories weren’t consistent since they came from different 
  sources. So, I had to figure out the categories myself. 
  To do this, I used ChatGPT. I fed it the headlines 
  from all 2,000 articles, in batches of 200, and it 
  helped identify the main themes based on the headlines.
</p>


<p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
  <strong>Place Names:</strong>I manually created a dictionary that included all place names in Bangladesh, such as sub-districts (Thanas), districts, 
  and cities, as well as country names and capital cities globally. Then I ran this dictionary against the text of the articles, 
  which returned the mentioned names along with their frequency count. I compiled the list by cross-referencing data from government 
  and open databases. This was necessary because existing named entity recognition tools, like <strong>spaCy</strong>, often overlook specific 
  place names, especially in places like Bangladesh. A random manual check determined that this method succeeded  nearly 100% of the time 
  in extracting all the names mentioned.
</p>


<p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">
    <strong>Frequent Words:</strong>To find the most frequent words for each publication, I used <strong>NLTK</strong>, a Python library for 
    working with text. First, I removed common stopwords ('the', 'is', 'and' etc.) to focus on words that reveal key themes 
    in the articles. I then calculated word frequencies. Instead of using raw counts, which can be misleading due to varying 
    article lengths, I normalized the word frequencies per 100,000 words. This provided a more accurate comparison of how often 
    certain words appeared across different publications, regardless of the number or size of the articles.
